    <h3>Description</h3>  
<p>The cake is called kue "cubit" (Indonesian: pinch) because of its small size: to eat it one has to pinch it.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>Pinch salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (60 milliliters) milk</li>
    <li>8 tablespoons (113 grams) unsalted butter melted and slightly cooled, plus more butter or vegetable oil for greasing the pan</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, beat together the sugar and eggs until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Slowly mix in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
    <li>Whisk in the vanilla extract, milk, and butter until just combined to form a smooth batter. Cover and allow to rest for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Place an Indonesian cake mold or aebleskiver pan over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Once heated, grease the cavities and decrease heat to medium-low/low.</li>
    <li>Whisk the batter a couple of times to mix, then transfer to a pastry bag or plastic bag with the corner snipped off. Pipe the batter into the greased cavities, about 1/3-1/2 full depending on the size of the pan.</li>
    <li>Cover the pan and cook for about a minute.</li>
    <li>Top the cakes with desired toppings such as sprinkles, cookies, or coconut. Cover the pan again and cook to desired doneness, until the tops are just barely set and still a little shiny or up to 4 minutes to completely cook through. Adjust the heat between medium low-low as needed to cook the interior without burning the edges.</li>
    <li>To make the Matcha Kue Cubit, whisk the matcha into the hot water until dissolved, then stir into the batter. Add more if needed to create the desired color.</li>
    <li>Carefully remove the Kue Cubit with a hooked wooden stick or small spoons. Repeat with remaining batter, greasing as needed, and serve immediately.</li>
